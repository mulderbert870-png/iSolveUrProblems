/**
 * M3.0e — Intent classifier types.
 *
 * 4 intents power the M3.0d test drive:
 *   - find_contractor  → user wants a list of contractors for a category
 *   - tell_me_more     → user wants details about a specific contractor
 *   - recommend        → user wants 6's top picks with reasons
 *   - book             → user wants to choose a contractor (fires M2.6
 *                         simulation in v1 test drive)
 *
 * The classifier is rules-based (regex) for v1 to keep latency <50 ms.
 * Slot extraction returns explicit structured data; the orchestrator
 * uses slots to call the right M2 backend route.
 *
 * "Contractor refs" are how the user identifies a specific contractor —
 * either by ordinal position in the most-recent list ("the first one",
 * "#2") or by name ("Acme Plumbing"). The client resolves ordinals
 * against the current assistant-surface state at action time.
