/**
 * M3.0e — Context injection wrappers.
 *
 * Each function takes a backend result and produces the "context message"
 * we send to HeyGen's brain via `session.message()`. The wrappers are
 * modeled exactly on the proven image-analysis pattern at
 * [LiveAvatarSession.tsx:975-978]: a leading tag tells the brain not to
 * read the wrapper aloud, the body provides the data, and the tail
 * instructs the brain how to narrate it.
 *
 * Keep wrappers SHORT and SPECIFIC. The shorter the wrapper, the less
 * latency between user finishing speaking and the brain producing the
 * spoken result.
