/**
 * Assistant Surface — types (M3.0b).
 *
 * The "results pop up on screen" right-side drawer that 6 drives during
 * voice conversations. Lives at the locale layout level so it persists
 * across navigation. The chat intent classifier (M3.0e) and any other
 * voice-driven action source can push variants into the store; the
 * surface component reads the active variant and renders the matching
 * panel.
 *
 * v1 covers exactly the four variants the M3.0d voice test drive needs:
 *   - contractors: ranked search results
 *   - summary:     review synthesis for one contractor
 *   - picks:       top 3 recommendations
 *   - pickResult:  win/lose notification dispatch outcome
 *
 * These are deliberately slim, client-friendly subsets of the M2 server
 * types. The orchestrator (M3.0e) maps server responses to these.
